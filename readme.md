## Presage2

[Presage2](http://www.presage2.info) is a simulation platform for agent-based simulation. It enables designers to investigate the effect of agent design, network properties and the physical environment on individual agent behaviour and long-term collective global performance.

### Features

* Java-based
* Unlimited agent computational complexity
* Inter-agent communication
* [JBoss Drools](http://www.drools.org/) rule engine integration
* Pluggable database integration (Mysql, Postgresql, MongoDB)
* Robust state representation and state changes
* Multi-threaded simulation
* Library of common tools (State machines, communication protocols)

### Usage

The library is distributed via Maven. To get started with using the platform, we recommend our [Getting Started Guide](http://www.presage2.info/w/Getting_Started_Guide). 

### Contributions

We're happy to receive contributions of both utility modules and extended core features. Please get in touch via github, or just open an issue or pull request.

### Further Information

* Further information about the software is available on the project's [wiki](http://www.presage2.info).
