Presage2-core
-------------

This project is the core component of presage2, a rewrite of the [Presage][presage] platform. The aim of this platform is to provide a simulation environment for agent-based social simulation. Presage2 will extend this platform to provide the capability to run experiments on a distributed cluster of networked computers.

The platform is currently in a very early stage of development and is not yet usable. Once it is basic guides will be posted on here for building and running agents.
